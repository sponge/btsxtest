Script Commands
...............

END
    Ends script read.

CREATE [symbol]
    Creates a new in-memory buffer, errors out if the symbol exists.
    Buffers are best used for speed, but large merges will consume
    lots of memory during merge.
    [symbol]: The symbol for the new buffer.

CREATEFILE [symbol] [path]
    Creates a new WAD file (on disk - not in memory), errors out if 
    the symbol exists or the new file could not be created.
    WARNING: If the file already exists, it is OVERWRITTEN!
    Files are best used for memory efficiency, but large merges will
    incur lots of overhead as the output file grows.
    See: CREATE for the in-memory version.
    [symbol]: The symbol for the new buffer.
    [path]: The file to create.

CLEAR [symbol]
    Clears an existing buffer, errors out if the symbol does not exist.
    If the symbol is a file, it is deleted and rebuilt.
    [symbol]: The symbol for the existing buffer to clear.

DISCARD [symbol]
    Discards an existing buffer, errors out if the symbol does not exist.
    If the symbol is a file, it is closed.
    [symbol]: The symbol for the existing buffer to discard.

SAVE [symbol] [file]
    Exports the content of a symbol to a WAD file. Directories are created for
    the file, if they don't exist. If the symbol is a WAD file (not buffer)
    and the destination is the same file, nothing happens.
    WARNING: If the target file already exists, it is OVERWRITTEN!
    [symbol]: The symbol to export.
    [file]:   The file to create and export to.

LOAD [symbol] [file]
    Creates a new in-memory buffer by loading an existing WAD file
    into memory. The symbol must not already exist.
    [symbol]: The buffer to create.
    [file]:   The WAD file to read.

FINISH [symbol] [file]
    Exports the content of a symbol to a WAD file. Directories are created for
    the file, if they don't exist. If the symbol is a WAD file (not buffer) and
    the destination is the same file, nothing happens. The symbol is discarded.
    WARNING: If the target file already exists, it is OVERWRITTEN!
    [symbol]: The symbol to export.
    [file]:   The file to create and export to.

VALID [symbol]
    Asserts that a symbol is a valid buffer.
    [symbol]: The symbol to test.

MARKER [symbol] [name]
    Adds an empty entry to [symbol] called [name].
    [symbol]: The symbol to add to.
    [name]:   The name of the marker.

DATEMARKER [symbol] [name]
    Adds an entry to [symbol] called [name] with the current date.
    [symbol]: The symbol to add to.
    [name]:   The name of the marker.

MERGE [dest-symbol] [src-symbol]
    Adds all entries from [src-symbol] into [dest-symbol].
    [dest-symbol]: Destination buffer symbol.
    [src-symbol]:  Source buffer symbol.

MERGEWAD [symbol] [path]
    Reads WAD entries from [path] into buffer [symbol].
    [symbol]: The symbol to add to.
    [path]:   The WAD contents to add.

    Reads file from [path] into [symbol].
    [symbol]:    The symbol to add to.
    [path]:      The file to add.
    [entryname]: (Optional) If specified, this is the entry name to use
                 to import as.

MERGEMAP [dest-symbol] [targetmap] [src-symbol] [opt:sourcemap]
    Reads a single map from the source, appending it to the destination.
    [dest-symbol]: The symbol to add to.
    [targetmap]:   The map to add (map header).
    [src-symbol]:  The buffer to read from.
    [sourcemap]:   (Optional) If specified, this is map to read
                   from the source symbol, and the target is the
                   new header name. If not, [targetmap] is read.

MERGEMAPFILE [symbol] [targetmap] [path] [opt:sourcemap]
    Reads a single map from the source WAD, appending it to the destination.
    [symbol]:    The symbol to add to.
    [targetmap]: The map to add (target header).
    [path]:      The source WAD file to read from.
    [sourcemap]: (Optional) If specified, this is map to read
                 from the source WAD, and the target is the
