C1TEXT = THE DARK COLONY OF SATURN X REMAINS -\nAN ERRATIC BACKWATER CONSTELLATION OF\nCRUMBLING RUINS AND VANISHING TECHNOLOGY.\nYET HERE IN THE COLD AND FILTHY CHASM,\nWHERE LIGHT-REVEALING HOLY GRAILS STILL\nWAR WITH THE GOD OF SHADOWS, A HIDDEN\nTOWER IS SEALED BENEATH A STILL AND\nFESTERING MOON. THE STUDDED CROWN ON A\nDYING PLANET. THE THIEF OF SOULS.  \n\nTHIS GAME WE PLAY. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S\nA MIRACLE OR A CURSE.
C2TEXT = I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE MALICE, BUT\nIT HAD NOT FORGOTTEN ME. WHAT IS THIS\nCONTRAPTION?\nTHE FOG OF NIGHTMARE DISSIPATES TO REVEAL\nA HORRIBLE REALITY, WHERE STREAKS OF\nMOCKING LIGHT IMPALE THE SKY, AND BROKEN\nCITIES SWOLLEN WITH THE CRAWL OF EVIL LURK.\nTHE DEMONS ARE REAL NOW. THEY HAD MOVED\nAROUND AS VESTIGES UNDER THE VEIL OF\nSHADOW, BUT NOW THEY WILL SCRATCH AND\nCLAW AND HATE UNTIL THE END, WITH ME AS\nTHEIR WITNESS. IT'S TIME TO DRAW A LINE.\n\nAHEAD IS ANOTHER PATH - A LONELY MILE -\nTAKING ME DEEPER INTO THE LABYRINTH OF THE\nTWISTED MECHANISM. THE FOUNTAIN OF FIRE\nLIES DORMANT, WAITING FOR THE SPARK.
C3TEXT = IT IS AN INCINERATION. THE PLANET IS PRIMED\nTO BURN BENEATH THE LOOM, AND THE PORTAL IS\nTHE ONLY WAY OFF IT. BUT STARING OUT FROM\nOTHERWORLDLY WINDOWS, THE TASK THAT LIES\nBEFORE ME IS NOW MORE REAL THAN DEATH, AND\nI KNOW THERE IS NO TURNING BACK.\n\nTHE WAY IS NOW OPEN. THE GHOSTS OF A\nDIFFERENT DREAM ARE WAITING.
C5TEXT = PERHAPS YOU HAD READ IT, ONCE. WRITTEN IN\nBLOOD PASSED DOWN THROUGH AGES. BUT DEEP\nDOWN INSIDE, YOU KNOW YOU WILL BURN FOR\nTHIS...\n\nENJOY YOUR FATE, YOU SINISTER COD!
