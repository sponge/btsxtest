WAR WITH THE GOD OF SHADOWS, A HIDDEN

THE FOG OF NIGHTMARE DISSIPATES TO REVEAL
A HORRIBLE REALITY, WHERE STREAKS OF
MOCKING LIGHT IMPALE THE SKY, AND BROKEN
CITIES SWOLLEN WITH THE CRAWL OF EVIL LURK.
THE DEMONS ARE REAL NOW. THEY HAD MOVED
AROUND AS VESTIGES UNDER THE VEIL OF
SHADOW, BUT NOW THEY WILL SCRATCH AND
CLAW AND HATE UNTIL THE END, WITH ME AS
THEIR WITNESS. IT'S TIME TO DRAW A LINE.

AHEAD IS ANOTHER PATH - A LONELY MILE -
TAKING ME DEEPER INTO THE LABYRINTH OF THE
TWISTED MECHANISM. THE FOUNTAIN OF FIRE
LIES DORMANT, WAITING FOR THE SPARK."
